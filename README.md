Instructions:
Open Xcode: Launch Xcode from your Applications folder or the location where you have installed it.

Open the Project: In Xcode, go to "File" -> "Open" and navigate to the directory where your SwiftUI project is located. Select the project file (with the .xcodeproj extension) and click "Open."

Select a Simulator: At the top-left corner of the Xcode window, you will see a scheme selector. It contains the name of your project followed by the name of the selected simulator or device. Click on the device name to select the simulator or device on which you want to run the app. If no device is available, you may need to create one in the Xcode preferences.

Build the Project: Press Cmd+B or select "Product" -> "Build" from the Xcode menu to build the project. This step ensures that the code is compiled and any dependencies are resolved.

Run the Project: Press Cmd+R or select "Product" -> "Run" to run the project on the selected simulator or device. Xcode will compile the code if it hasn't been compiled recently and then launch the app.

If running on a real device, please change teams from Signing & Capabilities
